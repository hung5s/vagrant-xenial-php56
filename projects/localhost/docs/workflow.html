<h1>Development workflow</h1>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>If you are new to this box or even new to Vagrant, you can use the sample project to play with the new working environment.
To setup the sample project:</p>

<ul>
    <li>SSH to your box (make sure you are at the root directory of your project):
        <br><code>vagrant ssh</code></li>
    <li>Copy Nginx config file for www.sample.dev:
        <br><code>sudo cp /host/provision/nginx/www.sample.dev /etc/nginx/sites-available/</code></li>
    <li>Enable virtual host:
        <br><code>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/www.sample.dev /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/www.sample.dev</code></li>
    <li>Check snakeoil SSL certificate:
        <br><code>ls /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem</code></li>
    <li>If you don't see the file, generate a new one:
        <br><code>sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem</code></li>
    <li>Restart Nginx:
        <br><code>sudo systemctl restart nginx</code></li>
    <li>Configure your host file to have <code>www.sample.dev</code> point to <code>127.0.0.1</code>.
        If you are on Windows, edit c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts. On Unix edit file /etc/hosts</li>
    <li>This box is configured to map port 8080 from host to port 80 in the box.
        To check www.sample.dev, go to
        <br><code>http://www.sample.dev:8080</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in your project</h2>

<h3>Shared folders</h3>

<p>You can access everything under your project root from /host inside your box. Your project folder should be under /host/projects/ inside the box</p>

<p>Folders in host and your boxes are synced thanks to VirtualBox shared folder feature (not Vagrant). If you have problem files are not synced, look for
debug info Vagrant shows while the box is booting up.</p>

<p>As folders and files are synced you can use IDE on your host to work as usual. You can install a GUI tool <strong>on your host</strong>
to work with Git or SVN, etc.</p>

<h3>Connect to your database server</h3>

<p><strong>This box does not have database server installed</strong>. You would rather use your host machine as the database server.</p>

<p>This box is configured to be able to access the host on IP <code>192.168.33.1</code> so that you can use this IP in your connection string.
    To change this IP, look into Vagrantfile where you found <code>192.168.33.10</code> is the IP of the box (.1 is the host).
    <br><strong>You may need to configure your database server to listen on this IP and allow access from the host IP</strong></p>

<h4>Example of PostgreSQL configuration on host</h4>

<p>PostgreSQL HBA file on a Windows host. File d:\pgsql\9.6\data\pg_hba.conf:</p>

<pre>
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             192.168.33.10/32            trust
</pre>

For PostgreSQL installed on Windows, it's already configured to listen on all IP addresses. If it is not your case,
look into <code>postgresql.conf</code> for <code>listen_addresses = '*'</code>
